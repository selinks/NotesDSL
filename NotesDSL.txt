NotesDSL<NotesDSL>


NotesDSL<NotesDSL>

NotesDSL is NL subset with added own syntax and semantics, represents NL thinking in NL typed NL notions as NotesDSL operating with NotesDSL notions-types-categories, that contain NL notions.

NotesDSL is initial notion-type-category, that contains NL description of itself.

NotesDSL syntax is regular, NotesDSL semantics is syntactic and represented as runtime of NotesDSL interpreter implementation of NotesDSL.

First law is that everything is vzaimosvyazano and everything have it's own cause.

PhysicalRealityLawSyntacticBehaviour potentially contains everything and is abstraction with abstract barrier from PhysicalReality <- EathGeographicLocation.

At first, possible to add NotesDSL goal, but it is very abstract, instead, it is better to add information about process of self-extending of NotesDSL.

PhysicalRealityLawSyntacticBehaviour{PhysicalRealityLawSyntacticBehaviour}

What type will be added next?

AbstractInterpreter (abstracting from Myself, but stills to be Personal) is NotesDSL implementation in NL, it's Runtime InitialState has NotesDSL Operations as NotesDSL CLI commands, for example, AbstractInterpreter.init. TODO: Add more description from PL.

GitHubRepositoryNotesDSLProjectApproach<NotesDSL.txt>{InitialState States LastState FinalState} <- Notes.txtRuntime is NotesDSL.txt representation, but we have Self-extendable AbstractInterpreter that writes it's own source code, extend it and interpret itself.

Could not define Metaknowledge, because all information about NotesDSL is already known.

Simply define Set subtype and describe all it's subtypes in Set{Set}.

PhysicalRealityLawSyntacticBehaviour{PhysicalRealityLawSyntacticBehaviour} <- Metaknowledge{Metaknowledge} <- Set{Set}


Metaknowledge{Metaknowledge}

Defined Metaknowledge for models of represented in Notes (NotesDSL.txt) NotesDSL, representation of representation, self-representation of self-representation, self-extending of self-extending.


Set{Set}

Set is collection of elements-objects with associations between them, always finite because 7 objects pruning rule. Set behaviour oncludes operations adding and removing. If remove all elements, get empty set, with representation as {} (syntactic separators-delimeters). In set are introduced 7 first elements of 7 subsets, so it is model of PRLSB - Set<AllFiniteSets<>>.

v0.0.5.2

Metaknowledge - Perception - Self-Perception


Metaknowledge{Metaknowledge}

Thinking in objects and associations.

PhysicalReality as basic type of all objects, interesting representation by Myself in Perception.

PerceptionStatesPercepting(PhysicalReality(Myself)) - Self-Perception(PhysicalRealityandMyselforConsciousnessorPsychicsorPerson).

Consider abstract objects that will be concretised later in subtype objects, process of Abstraction/Concretisation-Typisation is constant in Perception.

PerceptionStatesPercepting(PhysicalReality(Myself)) is abstracted/concrerised-typed as ProcessesStatesOperations(PhysicalReality(Myself)) - PotentialPerception, for all HumanBeings.

Self-Perception(PhysicalRealityandMyselforConsciousnessorPsychicsorPerson) is abstracted/concrerised-typed as PhysicalRealityLawSyntacticBehaviour - ActualPerception, for Myself.

In Self-Perception Metaknowledge is represented as MetaknowledgeModelofMyself.

So, PhysicalReality represents / is represented by Myself Perception, in Self-Perception Metaknowledge, MetaknowledgeModelofMyself, Myself appear.
